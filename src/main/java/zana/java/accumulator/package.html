<h2>(Unweighted) Accumulators</h2>

An <code>Accumulator</code> provides logic for high performance reductions of 
weighted primitive values to a single <code>double</code> value, for example, 
computing the mean of an array of weighted numbers.
<p>
Accumulators have state, which allows the value of the reduction to be updated 
efficiently when adding or removing new inputs.
<p>
Accumulators should be optimized for speed, and <strong>NOT</strong> 
thread-safety. They should be used so they are only visible to a single thread.
<p>
Two motivating applications:
<ol> 
<li> Optimizing the split predicate in greedy decision tree
growth, where fast updating and down-dating is critical to performance.
<li> Applying an 'additive' model, represented by a collection of term 
functions, to a single datum.
</ol>
<p>
The basic operation is to add or delete a single weighted primitive number.
The weight must be a non-negative number, usually <code>double</code>.
Unweighted add or delete must be equivalent to adding or deleting with weight 
1.0.
<p>
Other operations update the value by adding or deleting arrays or collections 
of numbers.
<p>
Accumulators support efficient 'map-reduce' updating operations of two basic 
kinds, corresponding to the motivating applications above:
<ol>
<li> Add/delete with a single value function, weight function, and a data 
array/collection. The value and weight functions are applied to
every element of the data, and the accumulator is updated with those primitives.
<li> Add/delete with collections/arrays of value and weight functions,
and a single 'datum'. Each element of the weight and value functions is 
applied to the datum, and the accumulator is updated with the result.
</ol>
