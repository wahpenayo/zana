<code>zana.java</code> contains small amounts of Java code for tasks
where it's easier to create a reliable, high performance implementation in
Java than in Clojure.
<p>
The most common reason is the type-hinting mess in Clojure. The syntax is 
inconsistent. Many type hints are ignored. There is support for 
<code>double</code> and <code>long</code>, but no other primitives.
<p>
Another reason is that inheritance is actually the right thing to do sometimes,
cersus taking the risk of introducing inconsistencies thru cut-and-paste.
